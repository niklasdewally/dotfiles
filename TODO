List of improvements to make next time I want to change my vimrc:
================================================================

* Move user snippets to its own folder in dotfiles and vim config. Make the "edit
  snippets" in vim automatically create / go to this custom snippets folder.

* Snippet for underlining in RST.

* C-j C-k to move around in telescope

* Update LSP and completion stuff to use nvim 0.11

* Better vimsurround setup

* Any more timpope / folke plugins to install?

* Remove a lot of stuff now in nvim natively!
  https://boltless.me/posts/neovim-config-without-plugins-2025/

  e.g. lsp_config, LSP keymaps, completion, builtin commenting (gcc), builtin, treesitter folding

  Perhaps next time try a mostly no plugin nvim setup (like native vim) and then add things as needed?

* Virtual lines diagnostics for rust (https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/#virtual-lines)

* Use treesitter for more things (https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/#improved-hover-documentation)

* Remove timpope vim-unimpaired, as a lot of that is now in nvim core:
