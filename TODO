List of improvements to make next time I want to change my vimrc:
================================================================

* Move user snippets to its own folder in dotfiles and vim config. Make the "edit
  snippets" in vim automatically create / go to this custom snippets folder.

* Snippet for underlining in RST.

* C-j C-k to move around in telescope

* Update LSP and completion stuff to use nvim 0.11
