List of improvements to make next time I want to change my vimrc:
================================================================

+ [-] Move user snippets to its own folder in dotfiles and vim config. 
      Make the "edit snippets" in vim automatically create / go to this 
      custom snippets folder.

+ [-] Snippet for underlining in RST.

+ [/] C-j C-k to move around in telescope

+ [/] Update LSP and completion stuff to use nvim 0.11
    + https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/3494
    + https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/

+ [ ] Add back workspace symbols, document symbols using telescope.
  - one that only shows functions and types in a document, not local vars?

+ [/] !td snippet

+ [ ]  Better vimsurround setup

+ [-]  autocomplete?? (whats the keybind again?)

        (C-x C-o)

+ [ ]  Any more timpope / folke plugins to install?
  https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim

+ [/] Remove a lot of stuff now in nvim natively!
  https://boltless.me/posts/neovim-config-without-plugins-2025/
  https://web.archive.org/web/20250324234646/https://boltless.me/posts/neovim-config-without-plugins-2025//

  e.g. lsp_config, LSP keymaps, completion, builtin commenting (gcc), builtin, treesitter folding 

  See also https://github.com/boltlessengineer/NativeVim, https://github.com/boltlessengineer/nvim_rocks

  Perhaps next time try a mostly no plugin nvim setup (like native vim) and then add things as needed?

+ [/]  Virtual lines diagnostics for rust (https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/#virtual-lines)
    (gK)

* Use treesitter for more things (https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/#improved-hover-documentation)

* Remove timpope vim-unimpaired, as a lot of that is now in nvim core:
  https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/#virtual-lines

+ [ ] How to change window split sizes without mouse?

+ [/] Readd some sort of git plugin -- maybe move away from fugitive?
  - some way to go to next conflict
  - diff3 conflict style seems broken with fugitive...


+ [/] Red squiggly lines for errors, yellow for warnings, etc with rust.

+ [/] format using lsp

* find todo should also find rust todo!()

+ [/] run shellcheck as a diagnostic?
      - I want to do this without an extra plugin, or lsp server if possible.
        To find out how, none-ls is a plugin that does this, as is mason.

      - diagnostic api?

      - Perhaps use https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint. Unlike the plugins
        null-ls/none-ls, ALE, this does not create a fake LSP for linters.
        Instead, it uses the diagnostic api.

+ [  ] remove blink, make snippets go through completefunc instead
      https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/rddugs/snipcomplua_luasnip_companion_plugin_for_omni/

      See the above article on neovim config without plugins - can also use
      treesitter as a query source too, and have fuzzy completeopt!

+ [ ] Read "why i got rid of all my neovim plugins" 
  - https://yobibyte.github.io/vim.html
  - https://lobste.rs/s/5sxrrp/why_i_got_rid_all_my_neovim_plugins


+ [-] Use conform for formatting
